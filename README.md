# Python-Ludo-Game



-CS 162 Portfolio Project.  Allowed to be posted to a public GitHub repo per Syllabus.  This is an implementation of the game Ludo in Python, using object-oriented programming concepts taught in the course.  It contains two classes with various functions, unit testing, and a main function that can be called with an array of players and array of tuples containg the game moves.

<h2>Test Cases</h2>

-Added 54 test cases to this project, 9 provided by the instructors.  

-Tested board position in the board game array, and token steps, boad space variables in the player object data members.

-Test cases were essential in this project to ensure that complex game rules functioned correctly, and that each new feature added did not break previous functions.  For example, this was helpful in adding token backtracking in the home spaces, deciding whether to kick an opponent's token, and token priorty rules in the game.
